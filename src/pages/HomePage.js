        Welcome to the Vibeception React App! This is a simple mobile-first web application.

        This is the homepage placeholder content. In a real application, this area would
        contain relevant information, features, and calls to action for your users.

        The entire application has been designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring 
        it looks great on devices of all sizes.
